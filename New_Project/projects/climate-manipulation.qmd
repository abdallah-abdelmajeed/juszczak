This project assesses the impact of warming and drier conditions on photosynthetic efficiency, productivity, spectral characteristics, and morphology of peatland vegetation under controlled in-situ climate manipulation experiments. The research provides insights into peatland resilience and carbon cycling under future climate scenarios.
