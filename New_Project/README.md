# Prof. Dr hab. inÅ¼. RadosÅ‚aw Juszczak - Academic Website

This is a [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Academic CV Theme](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv).

The site was migrated from Quarto to Hugo to better showcase Prof. Juszczak's research on peatlands and climate change. The site has been cleaned up to remove template content and focus on Prof. Juszczak's work.
